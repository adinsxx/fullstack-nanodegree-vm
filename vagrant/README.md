<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<p>This project is a RESTful web application that uses the Python framework Flask in conjunction with third party OAuth authentication. It showcases the basic importance of most applications: creating, updating, deleting, and reading.</p>

<h1>Beer Me</h1>
<p>I decided to create an app similar to that of Untapp'd, but that you simply just add your own favorite beers/breweries. Follow the instructions below to run it locally!</p>

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Install Vagrant and VirtualBox</li>
<li>Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm</li>
<li>Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)</li>
<li>Write your Flask application locally in the vagrant directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant within the VM).</li>
<li>Run your application within the VM (python /vagrant/application.py)</li>
<li>Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:5000 locally</li>
</ul>
and that should do it!
</p>
